# Motivation

The goal of this repo is to implement the same DL models in two frameworks:

* [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

* [tinygrad](https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad)

The models are implemented from papers with pretrained weights

I have no idea what I am doing

tinymodels is just for learning how models actually works

# Architectures

* [AlexNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5997.pdf)

* [VGG16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06798.pdf)
